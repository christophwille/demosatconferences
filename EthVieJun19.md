# Open Source Blockchain News from Microsoft

Vitalik Buterin had a guest appearance during Mark Russinovich's talk at Microsoft's Build conference 
earlier in May - on the topic of the Microsoft's open source Visual Studio Code tooling for Ethereum 
development. The demo then didn't work, so we will have a closer look at what the "Azure Blockchain 
Development Kit for Ethereum" is - turns out that if Azure isn't your thing, it still very likely 
will be the go-to solution for your Ethereum development. And the Azure-tied bits might 
inspire you for your own implementations.

Relegated to more of a cameo appearance - but long awaited - was the official revealing of the Confidential 
Consortium Framework, still better known by its previous name Coco. It is a consortium implementation 
using trusted execution environments (TEEs, as in Intel SGX for example) that is fully open source, 
and we'll have a technical look at its cryptographical and technical background.
