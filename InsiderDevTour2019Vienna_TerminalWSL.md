# What's new for the Command Line and Windows Subsystem for Linux

Windows 10 supports multiple command-line interfaces including WSL, CMD, and PowerShell, all of which 
build upon the Windows console. The Windows console has been updated throughout the years, but it’s time 
for a Big Change to help us all be more productive at the command line with a fresh and more capable 
command-line interface. Web and C++ cross-platform developers have also discovered how the 
Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) enables them to use their Linux tools and workflows on Windows, 
giving them the best of both worlds. In this architecture and roadmap session, join us to learn about 
the new open source Windows Terminal, WSL 1, WSL 2, and how they together enable developers to be happier 
and more productive in the natural home of developers: at the command-line.
