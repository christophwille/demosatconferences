# Graf Bobby entdeckt den Microsoft Graph 

The Microsoft Graph is the single endpoint for accessing cloud-stored information, either in organizational 
settings or for consumers. It allows you to find out about machines (think Intune), users and their relationships 
(think Outlook), as well as OneDrive, Excel and obviously Sharepoint. The Graph API is growing by leaps and bounds 
every month, and thus we cannot look at all API details. Instead, we are going take a look at the overarching 
concepts across all resource types, from authentication to common operations, to advanced concepts 
such as delta query and webhooks.
